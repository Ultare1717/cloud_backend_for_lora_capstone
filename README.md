This project aims to establish a robust cloud backend system for LoRa networks. It consists of three core components: Connection Establishment and Gateway Webserver, Cloud Infrastructure Development, and Dashboard Implementation.

### Components

1. **Connection Establishment and Gateway Webserver**: 
   - Establishes a connection between LoRa gateways and the cloud infrastructure via MQTT protocol.
   - Provides a gateway Webserver for configuring gateways with the cloud.
   - **GitHub Folder**: [gateway](https://github.com/fabinjoe/cloud_backend_for_lora_capstone/tree/main/gateway)

2. **Cloud Infrastructure Development**:
   - Develops an AWS-based cloud infrastructure capable of processing, storing, and managing data from LoRa sensor networks.
   - **GitHub Folder**: [cloud](https://github.com/fabinjoe/cloud_backend_for_lora_capstone/tree/main/cloud/lambda_functions)

3. **Dashboard Implementation**:
   - Implements an analytics dashboard for data monitoring and analytics.
   - Implements a control dashboard for sending control messages to gateways for control functionality.
   - **GitHub Folder**: [dashboard](https://github.com/fabinjoe/cloud_backend_for_lora_capstone/tree/main/dashboard)
